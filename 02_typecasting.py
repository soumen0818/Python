# TypeCasting = The Process of converting a variable from one data type to another.
# Python provides several built-in functions to facilitate casting, including int(), float() and str() among others.



name = "soumen"
age = 20
gpa = 8.2
is_students = True

# print(type(variable_name))

# gpa = int(gpa)

age = str(age)

# age += 2   => can only concatenate str (not "int") to str

# age += "5"  => Right ,because now 5 is string not number

print(age)
