#  Polymorphism == Greek word that means to "have many forms or faces"
#                  Poly = Many
#                  Morphe = Form

#                  Two ways to achieve Polymorphism
#                 1. Inheritance == An Object could be trated of the same type as a parent class
#                 2. "Duck typing" == Object must have necessary attributes/methods
